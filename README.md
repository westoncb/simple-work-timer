A simple timer for keeping track of how long you've been on the computer. The only controls are play/pause (toggled by pressing spacebar), and adding either 1 hour or half an hour of time.

To run:

cd to cloned directory
npm install electron (if you don't already have it installed)
npm install
electron .

(I think this is correct, but it should be verified...)
