A simple timer for reminding yourself to get off the computer after a certain amount of time passes. The only controls are play/pause (toggled by pressing spacebar), and adding either 1 hour or half an hour of time.

To run:

cd to cloned directory

`npm install electron` (if you don't already have it installed)

`npm install`

`electron .`

(I think this is correct, but it should be verified...)
